# Purpose
All work for the the Cloud File connector UI project by the Cloud Connect team.

## Build & deployment
All build, test, and deploy steps are now [performed continuously](https://gitlab.tableausoftware.com/cloud-connect/cloudfile-ui/pipelines) through automation built into this repo and found in the [cloud-connect/gitlab-ci repo](https://gitlab.tableausoftware.com/cloud-connect/gitlab-ci). The most current build and release process can be derived from those.

Manual build and deployment steps are contained in the [manual release process doc on mytableau](https://mytableau.tableaucorp.com/display/devft/Cloudfile+UI+%28manual%29+release+process).
